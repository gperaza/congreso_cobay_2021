The exercise might be accompanied by a small test that the code should pass, or a plot, or value which the code should generate if correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "A fundamental concept in computing is the use of a for loop to accumulate a result. A fill-in-the-blank exercise demonstrating an accumulator could lay out the initialization, provide the skeleton of the for loop and include plotting code, with the aim being that students write the update step inside the for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related patterns:\n",
    "This pattern is similar to Target practice; a difference is that Target Practice often focuses on a bigger step in a multi-step process. Fill in the Blank exercises tend to be smaller and more immediate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning goals:\n",
    "This pattern focuses attention on a component of a task and provides the benefit of demonstrating how that component fits into the bigger picture or a larger workflow. It can be an effective approach for taking students on a tour of an API, requiring that they use the documentation of the software, or for focusing attention on one aspect of an multi-step computational model.\n",

    "4.4 Target Practice\n",
    "Description:\n",
    "The Target Practice pattern focuses the learner’s attention on one component of a multi-step workflow. The instructor provides all workflow steps except the one which is the focus of the exercise; the student will implement the “target” step within a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "In a climate science assignment, the notebook that is given to students provides code for fetching and parsing 20 years of hourly average temperature data from a public database. Students are asked to design an algorithm for computing yearly average temperature and standard deviation. Following this, the plotting code which plots the yearly temperature with error-bars showing the standard deviation is also provided to the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related patterns:\n",
    "This pattern is similar to [Fill in the Blank] exercises. Fill in the Blank exercises are typically smaller and more immediate, while Target Practice exercises tend to be larger (e.g. an entire step in a multi-step process).\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning goals:\n",
    "The aim of a Target Practice exercise is to focus attention on one component of a workflow and practice skills for solving that component. It can also be used to reflect on broader consequences of choices made in the target step of an integrated workflow or analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience(s):\n",
    "This approach assumes some programming competency as learners are typically asked to start from scratch on the step that they are practicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Format (lecture / lab / …):\n",
    "This approach is readily used in assignments or labs. It can also be used in an in-class demo where the instructor live-codes the missing component. It is beneficial if preceeding steps have been discussed in earlier lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitfalls:\n",
    "As there is more freedom in the implementation, this approach is typically more engaging than a Fill in the Blanks approach. However, starting from more of a “blank slate” can require more instructor input in order to get students started. Unit tests and pointers to useful library functions are often helpful, but may over-constrain the space of solutions, thereby reducing the level of creativity and problem solving expected from students. The amount of guidance should be carefully calibrated to the class and can be adjusted by giving tips in response to formative assessments. Working in small groups can help mitigate the risks of students having trouble getting started or pursuing tangents."

    "Description:\n",
    "Students are given a notebook with a working example. They start by reading the text, running the code, and interpreting the results. Then they are asked to make a series of changes and run the code again; the changes can be small (tweaks), medium-sized (twiddles), or more substantial (frobs). For the origin of these terms, see The New Hacker’s Dictionary (Raymond, 1996).\n",

    "Offering manipulations on a range of scales allows students to interact with notebooks in ways that suit their background and styles. Students who feel overwhelmed by the technology can get started with small, safe changes, enjoy immediate success, and work their way up. Students with more experience or less patience can make more radical changes and learn by “destructive testing”.\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "In machine learning there are many steps to implementing an effective algorithm:\n",

    "Understand a problem\n",
    "Identify the proper machine learning algorithm to create the desired results\n",

    "\n",
    "Learning goals:\n",
    "This pattern helps students acquire domain knowledge by seeing the relationship between parameters and the effect they have on the results. It can also help students learn new notebook use patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is similar to “notebook as an app”; a difference is that in this pattern the code is more visible to the students, which can help orient them if they will make bigger changes in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audience(s):\n",
    "This pattern can work with students who have no programming experience; they only need to be able to edit the contents of a cell and run a notebook. It can also work with students who have no background with the domain; they can learn about the domain by exploring the effect of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Format (lecture / lab / …):\n",
    "This pattern lends itself to a workshop format, where students are guided through a notebook with time-boxed opportunities to experiment. It also lends itself to pair programming, where a navigator can suggest changes and a driver can implement them.\n",

    "Can help students overcome anxiety about breaking code, and build comfort with self-directed exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitfalls:\n",
    "One hazard of this pattern is that students might have trouble getting started, so you might suggest a few examples; however, another hazard is that, if you provide examples, students will do what they are told and fail to explore. A third hazard is that the changes a student makes might be too unorganized; in that case the effect of the parameters might be lost in the chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling technologies:\n",
    "Ideally the students should work in some kind of version control system that lets them revert to a previous version if they break something (and don’t know how to fix it). Note that undo and redo, Ctrl-z and Ctrl-y, can be used to traverse deep history within each cell, but not across cells."

    "Description:\n",
    "Particularly in STEM, the default sequence of presentation is bottom-up, meaning that we teach students how things work (and sometimes prove that they work), before students learn how to use them, or what they are for.\n",
    "\n",

    "In digital signal processing, one of the most important ideas is the discrete Fourier transform, which depends on complex arithmetic; in a bottom-up approach, we would have to start by teaching or reviewing complex numbers, which is not particularly engaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to writing the mathematics on paper, in a notebook students can use a library that does the discrete Fourier transform for them, so they understand what it is used for, and see the value of learning about it, before we ask them to do the work of understanding it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important methods are intrinsically leaky abstractions that require user expertise to use effectively and reliably. This is often because truly reliable solutions (if they exist) are disproportionately expensive for common cases. Numerical integration and methods for discretizing and solving differential equations often fall in this category. In addition to gaining intuition before diving into the details, the top-down pattern can be used to expose these leaks as motivation to understand the methods well enough to explain and correct for the shortcomings. For example, one can motivate convergence analysis and verification (Roache, 2004) by showing a solver that passes some consistency tests, but does not converge (or converges suboptimally) in general; or motivate conservative/compatible discretizations by showing a solver that has been verified for smooth solutions produce erroneous results for problems with singularities or discontinuities. Consider, for example, Gibbs and Runge phenomena, instability for Gram-Schmidt (Trefethen & Bau, 1997), entropy principles (LeVeque, 2002), eddy viscosity (Mishra & Spinolo, 2015), and LBB/inf-sup stability and “variational crimes” (Brenner & Scott, 2008; Chapelle & Bathe, 1993).\n",

    "Shows students value and rewards their attention quickly (see Win-day-one).\n",

    "Pitfalls:\n",
    "A potential hazard of this pattern is that students might be less motivated to learn how the tool works if they think they have already understood what it is for and how to use it. This hazard can be mitigated by making obvious the additional benefit of understanding how it works (assuming that there actually is one—it is not enough to assert that knowing how it works is necessarily better). “Interesting” failure modes (see examples above) discovered by students while trying to solve a problem are great for motivating deeper understanding."

Working out the eigenvalues with pencil and paper is tedious, and not the objective of the lesson.

    "\n",
    "In the usual presentation, students see and learn to do mathematical analysis on a series of simple examples, and resort to numerical methods only when necessary. In an alternative pattern, students skip the analysis and start with simulation and numerical methods, optionally visiting analysis after gaining practical experience.\n",

    "Examples:\n",
    "In statistics, hypothesis testing is a central idea that is notoriously difficult for students to understand. Students learn methods for computing p-values in a series of special cases, but many of them never understand the framework, or what a p-value means. The alternative is to compute sampling distributions and p-values by simulation; anecdotally, many students report that this approach makes the framework much clearer. Such simulation can also be used to drive home points about misconceptions held by most students and instructors (Haller & Krauss, 2002).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in queueing theory, there are a few analytic results that apply under narrow conditions; when those conditions don’t apply, there are no analytic solutions. However, queueing systems lend themselves to simulation and visualization, and in simulation it is easy to explore a wide range of conditions.\n",
